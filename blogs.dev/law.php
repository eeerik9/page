NATURAL LAW
initiation into deep exoteric knowledge hidden from humanity for milenia. 

Who is familiar with this term?
How many of you feel that Human Condition and life on Earth for humanity is tolerable just the way it is now
This presentation is just an aggregation of fragmented knowledge
As the old saying goes in all mystery traditions: "There is nothing new under the sun"
This means that Truth is singular and eternal. It has always been
here and it always be here. It is our perception that must be aligned with it. 

Truth itself by its very nature is belligerent (warlike, given to waging (vedena) war )
The truth is actually at war with a lie, with deception. It is at war with mind control. 

Some of you are very likely to be angered by things you will hear me say during this seminar. So be it. 
I do not present this information to be liked, to be popular, to make money, or to make friends.
I do this because I know, understand, but not live this information. The fact that I know this information in the time of such overwhelming ignorance places me in position of Moral Obligation and responsibility to speak this information to others, to make them understand that and live it as well.

Set aside your perceptions of me as the presenter. This includes things like how you think I look, dress, sound. Paying attention to such trivialities will detract your mental focus away from the information being presented. The information is what is important, not me. 
Be consciously aware of any impulses you may have to immediatelly reject information presented in this seminar solely (vyhradne) based upon your initial emotional response to the information being presented. It is logical fallacy (klam) to gauge (rozist) the veracity (pravdivost of any information based upon how you feel when first seeing and hearing it. 

When you hear or see something that you do not like, feel the emotion but do not immediatelly say it is not true and do not believe me either. It is about checking it, it is about a process of truth discovery. It should be based on your own research of this material. 

Try as much as possible to suspend immediate reaction of disbelief. 

This information is a tapestry. It is meant to be taken as a whole, in its entirety. If you decided to participate in hearing this information, I highly recommend that you stay for the duration of the seminar, otherwie, you will most likely not recognize the patterns inherent to the tapestry, and, more likely that not, you will have wasted your time. 

NATURAL LAW
The real law of Attraction and how to apply it in your life. 
I emphasize the real law of Attracion, because many people would be familiar with the new age variants of the law. This is going to differ quite widely from what people heard in the new age community or movement regarding of what the law or laws of attraction are. 

TEACHABILITY


An individual's teachability, or their ability to learn by way of being taught by someone else, is extrebely dependent upon the open-mindedness or closed-mindedness of the individual being taught. Low teachability derives from arrogance and rigid scepticism, but alsom from naivete and gullibility (dovercivost). High teachability derives from a balance between healthy skepticism and an open-minded willingness to learn and change. 


It means that you are able to hold a proposition (problem) in your mind without accepting it or rejecting it immediatelly. It means you consider the information with the open mind, okey, somewhat trustingly, but also somewhat sceptically. That is the mental state we want to be in during the duration of this seminar and therefore you will be in the best position to learn. 

Human beings should consider with great care their sources for information. By refusing to present certain information, and by influencing people to dismiss certain information as unimportant or unneccessry to consider, many modern institutions seek to control human perception and therefore limit what human beings may come to understand. They are limiting what they are able to do, to change to create in the world.  

Do not believe me, the worst thing you could do is to believe me, you have to work into it for yourself and the most important thing you need to do is personal introspection to really feel inside of yourself whether this information resonates with truth. Everybody has that intuitive capacity, that  also has to be turned on and engaged and used. 

If anybody si coming to the seminar with the perspective of modern organized institutional bodies, meaning political thought, political agendas, political organizations, religion,  religious thought, religious organizations, I am talking about organized religion here. What I call scientism, not real science but science set up by institutional bodies to be rigidly sceptical belief systems that blind out everything that could possibly say anything to the contrary of preexisting beliefs. I call that scientism and of course the new age movement which you can group up with the religion, it is just another form. It is for those who do not fall into religious mindset, this is the alternative religion proposed for them, and they call it the New Age Movement. 

All of these are boxex for consciousness, and this presentation is going to shatter all of these boxes. Because these are limitors of perception and thought. They try to place everything in the box and say nothing outside the box is suitable for human consumption so do not go there. And as the
result they act as mind control influence. The other and the biggest limitor of phuman erception and the mind and ultimately of our behaviour is money itself. You want to talk about the biggest 
religion, if these before are not enough for you,and powerful for you , this is the ultimate power in the world, the ultimate religion, the god of this world if you will. If you are in the mindset of discovering the reality from any of these perspectives, you will be surely very disappointed of what you are going to here because the information here falls way outside of any of these  institutional limitors for consciousness. 

REQUIREMENT for creating change and the role of knowledge. 
Human beings say that they want certain conditions to be present for both themselves and their species as whole, such as happiness, health, peace, freedom, prosperity, etc. However specific requirements exist in order for human beings to obtain those conditions. If the requirements for those conditions are not met, those conditions do not just manifest automatically by magical means. 

Most people say that they want these things but I do not think they are honest with themselves, they say that they want it but those are not automatic conditions, they just do not magically manifest, they are requirements to obtaining these conditions and people would not say they want these conditions if these conditions were already omnipresent. Right. They say that they want something because they do not have it at all or at least in fullness. When you say there are requirements, many will say, well I may not be willing to go there, I may not want to put so much effort and they believe that somehow they gonna magically get these things. 

Conditions that you want do not just manifest automatically by thinking of them, having a feeling about them, this Is a new age deception. There are requirements for obtainging conditions that we say we want, requirements exist in nature, it does exist. 

THE ROLE OF KNOWLEDGE
Since human beings, as a species, do not already have the things they say they want, it follows logically that the knowledge of the requirements to obtaining the things they say they want either must be absent or if present, that knowledge must be willfully being ignored. As long as these knowledge continues to remain unknown or ignored, the manifestation of the desired conditions will be impossible. Cannot happen. That is what we are going to talk about, what are these requirement, what is this knowledge. 

This knowledge is occulted
OCCULT KNOWLEDGE (hidden knowledge held by the few)
The word occult is derived from the latin adjective occultus, “hidden”, which comes from the Latin verb occultare, “to hide, to conceal, to keep secret”.
From the latin noun occulus, “meaning eye”, related to sight, vision. 
What is the occult, it is the body of knowledge that has been hidden away for specific reason. 





The top of the pyramid represents knowledge and the bottom ignorance. The knowledge is held by the few. The higher you go into the pyramid the more knowledge you have, but  the pyramid tapers, because at the top, very few people understand this information and have actually integrated it into themselves to the point where it bocomes understanding. Down you have no knowledge, ignorant masses and  up here you have people who are in the know, have knowledge about how this natural law works and are actully using it for certain reasons. Please keep in mind, during this text, if I use the word occult, all I am talking about is, the hidden knowledge, that is all what it means. 

What is this occulted body of knowledge, what does it comprise?
In mystery traditions or occult schools, they talk about these as arcana, latin, “meaning knowledge.
There are two bodies of arcana. Lesser arcana, the knowledge about microcosm,  small things, it does not mean it is less important, it means it deals with individual units of consciousness, the human psyche, the psyche of the individual. The second body is called the greater, the major arcana, it does not refer to it is more important, it refers to macrocosm, very large laws of nature that govern the macrocosm okey? And what is described in the text actually falls into this major arcana. Universal laws are part of the greater arcana of the occult knowledge. 

The occult knowledge constitutes both the knowledge of human consciousness and how it operates, and the knownledge of natural law, the unseen universal spiritual laws which govern the consequences of human behaviour. 

Natural is derived from egyptian and other middle eastern languages. The word nettere in egyption, meaning spirrits in egyptians. If you go into arabic or ancient arabic languages al as a suffix means all  related to. When put together, all it means is all that is related to the spirits. All related to god actually. So this is the spiritual domain, the laws that are actually operating in the unseen realm.  They manifest in the psysical realm, because that is the operation, it starts in the spiritual domain and then it manifests in physical. 
The lesser arcana is about the mournad, or the individuated unit of consciousness of the human being and the greater knowledge is about the laws that govern the macrocosmic universe. 



What these laws do?
They govern the consequeces of behaviour for inteligent species, being that are capable of coming to their understanding. I deliniate it from the animal kingdom. The animal kingdom is not held in the same standard as human kingdom when it comes to this information. Because I do not think you will sit down with your cat and explain natural law to it. So when people ask, why doesnt the animal kingdom held account in the same way as the human beings done. It is because, suprise, suprise,  we do not share the same level of consciousness. There is differences between the levels of consciousness and abilities to comprehend information and to actually know how something works just like you are not going to explain physics to your dog anytime soon. 

This body of knowledge has been called consequentiallism by past researches and teachers. It has been called karma, karmic law in the middle eastern or eastern traditions. In christian and western traditions, it has been called the moral law.  Religionists have called it god's law. 

Why is this knowledge hidden away from people?
It is not commonly known. It is not the exoteric, it is not given to the masses, it is the esoteric, it is reserved for the few and there is the reason for that. It has been deliberatelly hidden away in order to create and maintain a power differential between those who hold that information and those who are ignorant of it. 

The knowledge of the natural law and its operations constitutes the most deeply occulted information on Earth, which the Powers that Be seek to keep hidden from the People of Earth at all costs, because its understanding would “level the playing field” and put and end to the currently entrenched Systems of Control. And they are doing total number on us because we do not have this knowledge. And while we do not have this knowledge, do not expect the playfield to be leveled. Expect it to get worse. The natural law is the thing that is why all the distraction are put to place to keep you from learning that. Endless trivilities, the nonsense you hear on the news, all the video games, all nonsense television, the sports, you know. It is all there to keep people from understanding this. I cannot get you to accept that or believe it, and I do not ask you to believe it. I am saying that is what they are trying to do from my perspective of year being inside occult traditions that are very very dark. I am telling you this is what they do not want you to know. From first hand experience. Mark Passion was involved in the dark occult in the past. 

Nescience versus Ignorance
The context of Not knowing
Nescience 
from the latin verb nesciere
ne - absent
science - to know
to not know because the knowledge was absent or unattainable
This is the word practically sanitazed from collocquial english  and there is a reason for that too. 
It is not someone fault, there is no blame in nescience. 

Ignorance
From the latin word ignorare:
“to not know even though necessary information is present, because that information has been willfully refused or disregarded. “
Ignorance carries blame. This is another thing, people in New Age Movement often say this, nobody is to blame. And that goes to there is no cause for anything that is happening as you hear a lot in a new age circles. I very strongly put down these notions or I attempt to because there are causes and effects, there are people , who are responsible for what is happening. There is blame, blame exists. There are people who are culpable. 
Whether you refused it because it does not make you confortable or you disregarded it because you said that is not important for me to know.  I do not need to know that. Because you already understands something that contradict the thing you are hearing or seeing. So when you willfully disregard something . The meaning of the word ignorance is lost because of the way it is pronounced, please, start pronouncing it [igno:rens] then people will hear the word ignore in it and the connotation becomes clear. You are ignoring it. . . Because the truth is there and someone is trying to ignore it completely. Now that is inexcusable and there is a blame that is attached to it. So the question becomes: Do we have a nescience society or do we have an ignorant one. We are drowning in information. I think we are drowning in truth that is all around us, but people are ignoring it largly, not everyone, there is many who are very hungry for it and taking it as fast as they can. But the most of our population is ignorant about. And this constitutes this trans which people in community or truth movement refer to as, people sleep or are asleep. I like it to be called hypnosis, if you look at the origin of the word hypnosis, it means suppressed knowldege, it comes from greek, hypo means under as in hypoderma, under the skin, and nosis means knowledge, suppression of knowledge. That is the state where majority of people are in. And that is done by themselves. We have to stop looking at it if there is a victim, victim relationship, this is a willfull choice, in the time of overhelming information available at people’s fingertips, the truth being ignored is not an option. It is a willfull decision that people make. And it is the decision that they should be held accountable to because of what is going on. They are ignorirng it, they are allowing to go it in their name and they are not saying a thing about it, content to let evil run the monk.  And then people will wonder, why are we losing freedom, why is freedom on the vain. Why is totalitarism and tyrany rising up, why we see so much control and obsession with control in our society. Many of them will see this rising police state, injustice in society, restrictions on our inherent natural liberty, but here is the thing, many of them will not make the transition to grasping, they say yeah, this is what is happening to the earth, it is turning to be a huge prison, every day every where and at the most rapid phase here  in america and they see this lock going on to the cage with the question that they never get to. They will never get to the question not even the anwer. Why? They talk about the symptoms, they describe the prison, they describe every corner of the cage, accurately in many cases. They can tell you how it is working, they can tell you all the different aspencts of the control system but they cannot tell you why it is actutally going into place. Why is that happening. That is what this presentation answers, why we are losing freedom and it goes to the actual heart of that question. 

So, wha this presentation constitutes is a master key, that unlocks all the locks to all the doors on all the cages in the prison, if it is accepted. And once again, I wont tell you, belief is required for that. Because the truth is always present it is always here. It is of the fact, will we perceive it as a present, acknowledge about its presence, stop ignoring  it and then accept it into ourselves and then do something something about it. Understanding is not the end. Taking in the knowledge and the understanding is the beginning. Action is required. The knowledge is required, understanding is required but then action is finally required above all if change is to be created. That is how the laws of attraction do really work. So will that people as a whole as a society accept that master key? I cannot answer that question. All I can do is try to pass it to their hands after I had taken that key and unlocked my personal prison, my personal cages and free my mind, all I can do is to bring people to see, here is how this key works. Here it is, here is the information that constitutes that key and here is how you can put it into work into your life, it is all I can do. I cannot make anybody take it. 

But look what problem solving entails because it is very critical to understand if we are going to pass the stage that we are in our evolutionary development as a species. There are a few main steps to solving problem, any problem, does not matter what the problem is:
1 Recognize that there is a problem. Fear based denial of the problem must first be dealt with and conquered. 
Many people do not think we have a problem, they like this place, they like the world as it is. Which i do not comprehend, for me it is a living hell. And that is not because how my personal life is going. I am very content with my personal life, I have no self inflicted suffering in my personal life. I do not create problems for myself. My life goes on very well according to how I live it without hurting anybody else. The problem is other people, and that is another people, the new agers will not acknowledge and flip out and say there is a problem with someone else. Okey, there are problems with other people. and people would say, people in glass houses should not throw stone.  My glass house has been taken long since long time ago because I went through all this personal introspective work. And I went deep into my subcontious, faces those problems and confirmed they existed and healed them and came out of the mindset that I was once in. 
Mark Passio can say, with all honesty say, that he is not part of this problem. Knowing consciously that he does not engage in the activities of today’s world. But once, he was a part of this problem, a big part of the problem. What he had to do at some point was stopping pointing out that the problem lies elsewhere while I was still part of it. And then I have to point only at myself and say what do I need to change in my mind, in the heart and finally in  the guts, in the courage. The change happens in mind, it happens in the heart but lastly it happens in the guts. We have to generate heart ,mind, guts. You have to care about what you know and then put it into action. Taking action is the most important step when it comes to creating a change. The point is I have to look at what I have to change about myself in my thoughts in my emotions and in my actions and change those things in myself, this is what the most people wanna run away from they wanna say , I want those things that I say I want to be present in my life but I do not want to do those things htat require self change. I want it magically happen. Mark Passio can honestly say he does not see manifestation of himself in other people, but many others cannot because other people have not been through that process that he was, painfull, painstaking work, that involves effort, hard effort. I am not telling people I am offering you the tonic, that you sip and magically you will be englightened. Knowing what is going on in the world is a hard work, it involves destruction, it is a destructive process, it involves destruction of belief systems, it involves completely breaking down barriers that are in your head. Hardly anybody wants to do that work. People want to run a million miles away the opposite direction of this work. Anything but that, I take the grave instead of that, that is where the most people heads are at, you know,

1. you have to acknowledge how bad it is. People see symptoms of the disease and they want to ignore it because I do not want to believe I am sick. I do not believe I have a problem. Then you are waiting waiting waiting and you do not get it diagnosed and it turns to a much bigger problem. Which is where we are at as a society for ignoring this information. 

Denial symbolically is having your head in the sand like an ostrich. when you are in this position with your head in the sand, you are on your knees with your ass in the air. I often say, it is amazingly synchronistic that the human body was designed like that in order to put your head in the sand, you symbollicaly so to speak, you have to be on your knees and that is where the most of the society is in. 

2. Recognize that symptoms that are being displayed are merely effects of underlying causes. Therefore, instead of simply treating symptoms, make an accurate DIAGNOSES of the CAUSES of the problem. You can not treat symptoms and solve the problem, it is not possible, that is not how the problem solving works. You have to get to what caused the problem.

What the word diagnosis mean

DIAGNOSIS

from the greek preposition dia "through, by way of, by a method, and the Greek oun

gnosis "knowledge"

BY WAY OF KNOWLEDGE 

You are going to solve the problem by way of knowledge, if there is not knowledge you will not solve the problem that you have. 

The new age community are lying to people whether through willfull deception or  useless dups, they want people suppressed and non active, they want people in acceptance mode of everthing. Accept accept, accept and never rebel. Do not take action, just observe, watch you hear all these things in the new age movement. The reason why I bring it up is, when you use a word knowledge to some new agers, they almost take offence. Because of what the new age is becoming is a modern date varient, it is a new form of  what is known as sollapsicsm. 

People do not want to hear, that the knowledge is required. because the attainment of real knowledge not sude knowledge, requires work, it requires effort.  it requires reading, it requires listening it requires watching and most of all it requires, what the people do not want to give up  it requires time. That is the currency that people do not want to spend on things that they do not feel that they get immediate gratificaion from. that is why the immediate gratification is so stressed in our society by the control system.  that is what keeps people in their ignorance. So the diagnosis means, if you want to get well you have to have the knowledge of the underlying causal factors that led to the creation of the symptoms. You have to find out what cause has put this into effect? 

3.Through the knowledge acquired via accurate diagnosis, take the required ACTION neccessary to rectify the causal factors which led to the manifestation of the problem. 

act on the knowledge you now have to solve the problem to make it right, so action is required. 

The concept of truth

TRUTH vs. PERCEPTION

because people have deeply mystified concept of what the truth is.what it means. they get into this really deep abstract distraction  the mind of god, trying to get into quantum theory of everything. This is mystifying, we have to bring it into a simple understandable language language that anybody can comprehend and then really completely deliniate that from perception of any given thing because the two are not the same. When people say, perception is the reality, nothing could be further from reality.  perception is not reality it is just as it is written seeing through something like a lense or filter. I perceive things differently with the glasses. that is how human perception works, it is the lens, it is the filter, but what is there is the same thing. All that changes is how I perceive it. Truth is objective meaning that it is not based on the perceptions of human beings (which is capable of wavering). Truth is simple that which is. It is that which has occured in the past and that which is occuring in the present. The truth is not dependent on perceptions of human beings, that is a direct assault on human ego. everybody wants to hear that my perceptions are accurate and important. Why are my perceptions accurate. I went through this destructive perception. Most people do not want to go through the process or are as hard as diamond, they are not willing, they are calcified. they have been so compressed in this hard state that they do not want to start. I say that your perctions are not what really matters. The truth is not based on how you perceive things. It is independent on how we perceive things. Human's perceptions are capable of vawering, they can vawer slightly from the truth and they can vawer wildly from the truth. What truth is that what does not vawer, it does not move  it is something which is. It does not matter, what anybody thinks about it,  if anybody believes it, it does not matter if anybody knows it, it does not matter if anybody sees it, it does not matter if anybody wants to see it. it is there it has always been there it always gona be there, nothing anybody does can change what has happened. Can anybody change what has occured, in thinking of linear time, the past? Not one person here is capable of doing that, let me tell you something, not one being in manifested universe is capable of doing that because that which has already occured is set in the record of the universe. Nothing can change the past. (Watch the new movie time maschine). This movie got crushed in reviews, whenever reviewers crush the movie and give it the worse ratings, go and see this film. I guarantee you, there is a very important allegorical concept you need to understand embedded in that film and that is wy reviewers crush cause they do not want you to get any ideas. This movie got crushed in the theatreas and I guarantee you it is the best movie to understand the concepts of the absolute impossibliity of changing the past. You know what can be altered, the future, and that is what this movie is about. You know where the alteration of hte future begins in the present moment. that is exaclty right, that is the only place it begins. The demystified concept of truth is simply that which already exists. It is that which has happened in the past and is happening in the present moment. The  truth does not exist in the future. When we get to the future the it will be the truth but not until. There is no such things as truth in the future. The truth is that which has occured in the pas and which is occurring in the present and that which is and what has been. That is what I am talking about when I am talkng about the truth, the events that have taken place in the past and are taking place in the present and guess what, that is the whole the truth is. It does not need to be more complicated than that. If you want to put it more complicated, call it something else but truth. 

Truth vs. Human Perception 
Imagine this white lines that does not waver is the truth. Take three individuals blue green red. Their ability to see what has occured and what is occuring is what I refer to as consciousness. Consciousness is an ability to recognize patterns and meanings with respect to those patterns .Meaning you have an accurate understanding of things happening around you or you have an inaccurate understanding of things happenig in and around you. If your consciousness is high, meaning it is a high frequency you have a higher ability to recognize these patterns, if your consciousness is low, you are a low frequency and you see the pattern less you are not gonna accuratelly perceive. I put it into a wave form in simple physics, a sine wave. The distance between the crossing is called the wavelength. The longer the vawelength, the shorter the frequency. What that means is how frequently is it going to be intersecting the line that is representing the truth. How frequently is it going to be alingned with this line which we are calling the truth. This is a low frequency vibration, low wave. It would produce a low base tone. As we go up to the higher frequency, the wave lenght is shorter. It intersects the line much more frequently. The higher the frequency, the more aligned with truth we are. What would happen if this frequency became infinitely high? what would be become. It would be indistinguishable from the line. Someone would be alingned to which is. The higher the level of  consciousness or the frequency, which is the perception of reality being accurate. The higher the frequency, the higher the perception of reality. 
Perception is not reality, it is the filter we see reality through. What the human beings work is to do is to align their perceptions to reality which exists which is truth. We need to set aside what we want the truth to be but to see what it is. What it is is all together different than we want it to be. Until you recognize what it is you are not even in the position to make accurate diagnosis what is going on and therefore create what we want to be. The first quote.  
Travis Walten  - Book Fire in he sky. 
‘i have come to realize that the biggest problem anywhere in the world is that people’s perceptions of reality are compulsively filtered through the screening mesh of what they want, and do not want, to be true. ‘
We want things to be true, that does not make it so.  That is not what makes truth the way that it is. What makes the truth what it is is what behaviours have been taken and what are the actual facts in the manifested world. that tells us how the things are. it does not matter how we want them to be, they may be completely different way than we want them to be and I would say that they are in the completely different way. But for most people, they kind believe that they are the arbitor of truth and that is the bad place is to . and that is a very low level of consciousness that I believe it is this way. 
The new age movement is the religion that is designed to supress the masculine side of the personality which is actually the side which takes action and makes change ok. And that is also pushed by sacred feminine which is care and creativity or an compassion . Both need to be present. What new age religion wants to teach people is just accept everything the way it is, it does not matter how in just it is no matter how bad conditions are no matter how much evil is taking place in our mids, accept it. 

Solipsism
(Coarsing miracles)
solus -alone, ipse -self. 
The ideology that only one’s own mind is sure to exist. Solipsists contend that knowledge of anyhting outside one’s own mind is unsure, hence there is no such thing as objective truth, and nothing about   the external world and it’s workings can actually be know. 
a completelly egoic ideology, no resemblance to truth in any way and the people who are solapsists are mentally ill who should be segregated from the society and institutionalized until they are made well. 
When you do not understand where the words came from you do not really understand what they were really  ntended to mean. Regardless of any other conotation they have taken on in the modern world, the intended meaning, original, of the word is derived from its etymological derivation. YOu need to go to ancient languages, latin and greek roots, germanic arabic. You need to break down the words from their etymological origins than you understand the words their real meaning. And I am telling you you do this and the top of your head will blow out by what you will find. What words we speak on daily basis actually mean and we have no idea what they mean. 
These people want to believe that this whole spiritual domain is such an illusion that nothing that takes place in it does not matter should be only watched and nothing can be done about it. 

Satanism
list of sins
these are behaviours and thought patterns that should not be enganged in by the dark occulltest themselves, by the magician if you will. You cannot not engage in these behaviours but we are to peddle them to other people. We are to get them to engage in these behaviours. 
1. stupidity
2. pretentiousness
3. Solipsism
4. self-deceit
5. herd conformity
6. lack of perspective
7. forgetfullness of past orthodoxies
8. counterproductive pride
9. lack of aesthetics
The idea is we will know it all we will know the truth, so that we can control others and keep them dark down herd. 
Dark occultests will put the idea into the hands of usefull dups the material to write books on new age bullshit. And we are going to propagate and peddle solapsism like you have never seen. And when they say something they are doing it. I am serious they act on the level, on the same page, and for that I have respect for them as an enemy. I recognize they have the will htey are not like the rest of humanity. they align they thoughts, their knowledge with their version of care, it is not like our emotional based care, but they care about what they are doing and then they act. and when they act they act in concert. they get it done. I am not saying I agree with any of their agenda, but I have respect for their unity, humanity is not united. 
The point is that it is world religion. It is about people that give up life. that is what makes me confortable in my ignorance and laziness. We are battling this force.

People believe that the spiritual domain is separate from the physical domain, this is the huge threat.If you think that spiritual domain is not where you are right now because you are in the physical domain, you are mistaken. If you believe that the spiritual domain is somewhere other than the physical domain you are also mistaken. 
If you make ephasis on one or the other and say this takes precedence and this is not important, it is imbalance and it is not truth. 
If you say, matter does not matter, or this is just a big physical clocwork built randomly, both of these world views, they are inaccurate, not based on truth, based on brain imbalance. natural = unseen spiritual
law
existing - it is present, it cannot be ignored, it is in operation
binding -it has an effect
it does not matter if you believe it has an effect it does not matter if you understand it, it is in effect
that is another desction process to the human ego. It wants to hear, universe cares about you personally, it cares about john it cares about mary... individually as a being, you can go so far to believ that the creator of this universe cares about you . I am not denying it, what I am saying is the laws of the universe do not care about you. Laws have been created in this realm, that work, that work flawlessly, one hundred percent of the time, flawlessly. To clarify it: A couple are in the picnic, a 50 yards away is a cliff which ends in rocks, they have take their child their kid, 2 year odl daughter go and ends at the edge of the cliff. Will the gravity care if she goes over the cliff, will gravity allow her to go over the cliff? yes it will, gravity does not say this girl does not understand this law and she will die if she will go over the edge, she is innocent, she is nescient, not even ignorent, will that law still have an effect. You damm better believe it will have and so the natural law works the same way, it does not care if you do not know, it does not care if you are nescient or ignorant, it is in effect, binding and immutable, nothing anyone can ever do can ever change it because the man has not put it into effect, the creator did, and I do not care what do you think of it, as an impersonal force, or man in a beard, or this remote control I do not really care what you do think it as. Personally, that is not of my bussiness. But you know what if you think of it that it is a man, that makes the "laws", then I have a problem. Because the man does not make these laws I am talking about. The creator of this universe set these laws in a motion put them into an effect and they bind you, you and I are bound by these laws, whether we like it or not, whether we accept or not, whether we understand it or not. They are in effect and you are already creating the reality that we are experiencing based upon the interaction these unseen laws, already. You already doing it. You can never be not doing it. That is an impossibility. You are always creating in cooperation and can never do otherwise as long as you exist in the physical domain. 
Do you think that we can create something good, something that we say we want when we do not understand how these laws operate. YOu know what is going to be created? A mess, total chaos. Something you do not want, something which leads to enormous suffering which is where we are at. If on the other hand have knowledge about how does these things work then you align behaviour to them you gonna create the whole new different game. 

this is not an untestable hypothesis. it is not a hypothesis. it is law. You can apply all scientific methodology to it, same thing, gather you information, hypothetize,, observe, test the results, publish the results. This is a science, it is a scientce, hat consitutes knowledge, how the laws that are existent in operation and immutable in this universe work and about how we are creating what we experience in conjunction with this operating laws. 
if you want to stop suffering and change human condition you have to know these laws, there is no way around that. Knowledge of these laws is required, and this is what the people in religious communities do not want to acknowledge. They do not want to akcnowledge taht the work is required

this is a sound bite definition
natural law is universal, non-man-made, binding and immutable conitions that govern the consequences of behaviour. Natural law is a body of universal spiritual laws which act as the governing gynamics of consciousness. 
I would say that in universe it governs the behaviour of all inteligent beings. Intellingent. 

Discovery vs. Belief
Natural law is capable of being discovered understood and harmonized with. 
Religion wants people to believe, accept and do without question 
What this is saying is, this exists, you are bound by it, the best you can do is to understand its operation like you understand the gravity and therefore not go at the edge of two hundred high cliff that is surronded by rocks. If you are inteligent and you understand how the law of gravity works you will not do that behaviour. Just like when you are intnelligent and understand how natural law works you will do certain behaviours to create a present for your entire species for your entire species. Unfortunatelly the humanity has not yet reached that level of consiousness yet, they are not at level of cocreative intelligence. 
Natural law has nothing to do with religion, it is not a belief system, it is a science, it is a discoverable operation that is already in an effect, that we can either understand and align our behaviour to or remain ignorant of and suffer as the result of that ignorance because it is already in effect. 
Here belief is irrelevant, because natural law does not care about you, it is in effect whatever you do and people do not want to hear it, and I recognize it. I recognize I am not telling anybody anything that they want to hear. (wayn dyer -new presenter)
I do not care about fake money I care about real moneye, real one eye, the world money is actually one eye, which represents the spiritual enlightment and it is placed over dollar bill. So I tell people, I am a poor man when it comes to fake money, but I am very rich when it comes to real stuff. 

If I wanted to stay with someone ego I would say your beliefs are very important, they shape your reality, they do shape your reality in a negative way if you do not align yourself with the truth. And you want to stay attached to a belief system because you prefer to put it over what is real. I am also not telling people do not believe in yourself. I understand that Believe in yourself in your ability to understand this information. But I explain when it comes to a law that is existing in the universe, your belief does not matter, the universe does not care what those parents believed. Like a computer, you put this in, that is the way you program it, that is what has to come out, invariably, it is nothing personal. It is a impersonal force, which every singly mistery tradition and occult tradition which actally wanted to share this info with people has been telling people about and attempting to tell people about since time immemorial. No one wants to hear that. 

Humanity greatest fear is that the truth is absolute. The ego has the hard time with any absolute truth. It loves relativism, it is another part of the big trap of where we are at. Relativistic ideas and especially when it comes to morality. Natural law does not require your belief to be in effect no more than gravity requires your belief to be in effect. 

Human belief is completely irrelevant when it comes to the existence and operation fo natural law, just as it is irrelevant in relation to any of the other laws of nature, as gravity, inertia, momentum, thermodynamics, or electromagnetism. Similar to such other phenomena of nature, the workings of natural law require no belief in order for them to be discovered and known. 

There are two ways to be fooled. One is to belief what is not true (all religionsorganized, money, scientism, new age movement, government), the other is to refuse to accept what is true. 
(Soren Kierkegaard)
this si how humanity creates selfinflicting suffering in our species. 

Consciousness and the brain
Consciousness is an intangible force, it is something that exists, but you cannot really see it. But there is a phisiological expression for consiousness in a physical domain and the brain is one of them. Also the heart, it has the bigger electromagnetical field. 
You have to understand the basic structure of the brain to understand the basic imbalances that go within it. These systems also prevent the activation and action of the heart. Not only they prevent the real knowledge from manifesting within the being, they prevent the care, and they create apathy, they create inaction, laziness, cowardness
Consciousness
the ability of a being to recognize patters and meaning with respect to events taking place, both within oneself (inner lesser realm) and in the realm in which the self exists and operates (biggerrealm microcosm).
And the events taking place is the truth, it is the ability to accurately perceive truth of what has happend and what is happening. 

How does consciousness express?
How can any other being know who you are:
thoughts (mind) speech is the form of thought
emotions (spirit)
actions (body)
thought is a natural body, everything in order to exist in the physcial domain is a thought. someone had to invision all the parts and put it together. 
YOur emotions are polarized component, it is a feminine aspect of consiousness, other people do not feel your emotions they can perceive them or sense them, you are the one that is feeling  the emotions in your phisiology, it is an internal expression, a feminine.
It is the spirit in which we do something. 
There is a marriege, the thoughts as a creative essence, which then blends or marries to emotions. We get to religious notions, where it is called the trinity, and I challenge anybody to look at any existing trinities in any of the religions. Every single religions tradition is always . A father creator, a sacred feminine figure of some kind that the father then impregnates or inseminates and then from that offspring is born a male child always. Father is the mind, emotions are the sacred feminine essece, or the holy spirit, and then the child, the male child is the behaviiour, it is the active or the masculine principle which actually interacts with the physical world to change and hence that is the only way to save our selves. Religious people would say, ssaving yourself will not come through the faith, yes I am, saving oneselves can only come through action. Action will save humanity, faith will not do it. This religions are created by the control system. People do not understand that the exoteric christianity is created by the dark occult, of the ancient dark occult of mystery schools and they do not understand where this notion comes from because they have not studies astrotheology. I m not telling you that there is not any good concept in any religion, I say take all the good concepts and leave the nonsense. As one of the nonsense, that you need to believe something to be saved from the current human condition, You do not need to believe in a thing, you need to know the truth. 
let me stay there, in their own scriptures, the exoteric christian scritpures, what is the one prescription that christ figure gives to the people when he is asked about freedom. He is only asked about freedom lik once in the gospels. What will save us, what will make us free. Knowing the truth will make you free. I am not inventing words up here, I am telling you how it really is, I do not care whom it offends. 









Admiralty law<br>
common law, trust law, symbolism, admiralty law
ignorance is no excuse to the law. if you do not know the law, they enslave you

you think that when you are born, you have nothing to do with
sea, but basically it ain't true. You are 70% of water, you come 
out of womb, which is full of water. Therefore, under admiralty
law, you are in aa ship and you are going to dry land, you are docking. From 
the ship.
When they created the birth certificate, the way that happens is
that when you are born you parents sign a certificate of life
birth and it is signed and authorized by a doctor, goes off
and you got a birth certificate. you think that they are the same 
but they are not. The first one is life birth and second one is
birth certificat. what they do is that they do a dummy corporation in your name. 
The name on your birth certificate is not you even if it seems like you. 
For example, you are on the ship JS Titanic, and your name is
John Smith Titanic. Does that mean, that you are the same as the ship, just
because you have the exact same name. 
When you are born, you are actually by admirality law berth from 
the birth canal through vessel which is made primarily of water. 
You are connected to the ship with you embilical cord (pupocna snura).
When you know anything about admirality law, what is called the miliary of sea
it is called the navy  Well, what is another name for your belly 
button? It is called navel. These things are not coincidences.
When you are born, you come from the womb, they cut you from the ship,
 which is placenta and basically you leave the placenta behind. Now, what
 is placenta besides water? Well, you DNA. So they actually have a proof that
 they end up owning you and this is how they own you.
Not you human being but your dna.
How they have the ability to create a fictional corporation under you name 
and label you as a person. Well, if you look up a legal definition of a word
 person. It means a fictional character, a corporation, so it is not you, 
even though it has your same name. And this is how they get away with it. 
So when your mother gives birth to you, they take the baby home, they sign 
the certificate of life birth, the doctor graphs his signature, confirms it
 as a witness. Which by the way, when the ships comes to port, what is it 
called? It is a doc. Well who is the person, who is authorising this. 
A doc helps you with a baby, a doctor. these are not coincidence. 
So in admirality law, the whole idea  from bussiness and comerce 
between contries and shipping goods from one country to another, 
when the ship docked into port. On the vessel, 
they take each particular item and they have to register it and gave 
it a certificate of birth, which means, it is a cargo. This is where 
the birth certificate come from. When goods come, they register the product,
 where it came from and its registration number. Sounds famililiar 
on the birth certificate pretty much. 



you ever noticed, there is on the newspaper, they say john and marry gave birth to 
a child. You are thrilled, isn't it. However, it is more like lost and found
They are saying, we found that dna in hospital, whose is it. 
You go to barber you get a haircut and you say it is a nice haircut. However,
you left behind your hair, your dna. Now, the hair is the property of the barber
it is the proof that they can do with it whatever they want. 
They are making profit of your dna. But they can because you have abandon it.
When parents gave birth to you and left placenta behind. The state says we 
found the dna of a baby, which proves who you are and
The ignorence is no excuse to the law. The silence is same as concent. 
Going for dinner, paying separeate
Example, we are eating a pie and there is left one piece left. I want to make
a legal clain to that piece of pie And I claim 
Would like to eat that last piece. Other people have choices. 
In law, if you do not say anything, the pie
is considered abandoned and 
In law, if you make a claim ofsomething and the parties involved did not argue or
dispute it or make any additional claims, 
just silence, they comply with your claim.


They are not talking about physical baby they talk about the dna. 
But your dna can prove because it is linked to you.

consider you dead, lost at sea. Because of the fact, that you did not claim that
the dna is yours or your parents did not claim it.
Silence is the same as consent. 

Symbols
The reason they have symbols is that through the history the average person could
not read and write even kings could not read and wirte. Who transfered the laws in the history, 
the clergy. The people who wrote the bible, also wrote the laws. The average person did not know what the
law was till they could not read or write. 
if you are driving alone in a car and you see a colour turn from green to red. 
you stop. It did not say to stop, there is no word to say to stop. It just symbolizes to stop.
so even if you could not read or write you knew what to do. So now you know what symbolism is. 

In the law, there are several words, of which if you do not know the meaning, they can enslave and entrap you. 
Now let's get to the constitution. First of all the way they can enslave you is, that when you are born your parents 
leave behind the placenta, your ship. It is in a figurative sense, you are a creature of water. You are born into 
this boa or vessel. 
You leavve the vessel into dry land through yoru vessel, which is placenta. Your parents leave the placenta behind. 
They leave your dna
and also they take blood from your left foot. From your soul of your foot. Your soul. It all goes into play. So after
couple of days they post into newspapers
such and such gave birth to you. You think it is a nice thing they are doing. Actually, they are doing a lost and found.
 Hey we found a dna. Do you want to claim it?
If nobody does it. Oh they did not claim it, they must be dead. They are allowed legaly, not lawfully, there is a difference,
 to claim that you are dead and create a 
fictional character or corporation. So if your name was Steven Samuel Titanic. What they do is when you sign that certificate
 of life birth and you send that away, they wait for
somebody to claim the dna and if nobody comes they say, they create Steven Samuel Titanic, the corporation. And they send back
 instead of certificate of life birth, a birth certificate. 
It is not you, that means you are a cargo.  What they do is they put it in all capital letters So when you look at your birth 
certificate now or you driving licence, they are very few exceptions,
you ll see your name in all capital letters. You think it is just a fun. No, it is a symbolism. symbolism means, it is
 a fictional character, a cprporation, so that is not you. <br>
<br>
So now what is a corporation? 
Let's use for example, MC Donalds. Mc Donalds is a corporation. If I was to ask you, what that corporation is. Well if you 
point to Mc Donalds and say, this is a Mc Donalds corporation. You would be wrong, 
because that is jut a building that they do their bussiness in. That is not the corporation. Then you can say, hey, what about
 the corporate headquarters. That could be a corporation of mc donalds and thats where they do
all their bussiness. Again you would be wrong. That is not the corporation that is just the building they do bussiness in. So
 what is the corporation. Well let me show you. When you register a bussiness you send them money your fee
and they send you back a certificate, that has this word on it MC DONALDS. The letter says MC donalds in all capital letters. 
This is the corporation. It is a title it is a piece of paper. That is not the physical part, that just means that you register   name
as corporation which you can do bussiness under. If you want to do Mac Donalds out of your back yard, if you are owmer of that 
corporation, you could. So the bussiness itself is not the corporation it is the name. <br>
<br>
So when they talk about you as a corporation,  they are not talking about you specifically, they are talking about the piece of paper, 
that has a bussiness name of Steven Samuel Titanic or whatever name you have. <br>
<br>
So how we got where we are today. most people do not realize it, but there are actually two constitutions, the original constitution 
was created in 1781, ratified in 1785 and was exactly the same as the new constitution you do not know about except 
for two different wordings. Everything else is pretty much exactly the same. What they did was, the original constitution says 
instead of  for the people they change it to of the people.  Goverment work for the people to people work for the government. 
It does not sound as a big deal to you . the second word is a big one, this is where they enslave you. This is why your votes do not count,
 why you have to have drivers licence and pay taxes. You do not have to do this you have just subjected yourself to do so. 
They changed it from The united states of America which is the country to United States. Now most people would say, well,  that is the same thing,
 well, no it is not. United States of America (5 dollar bill in 1864) UNITED STATES. In law, everythign in capital leters is a fictional character,
 a corporation. So what they did was, they did this during the civil war, because the civil war had nothing to do with slaves or freeing the slaves.
 It is only excuse. It as any military today. It is all about starting a centralized bank, taking over the peoples resources and creating money. 
and the reason they say things like for example us going over to the middle east, they use the justification of
well we will gonna liberate people and they use the death of children and women to have peoples back to go there. Well if they said well
 we gonna start a war over an Iran and we just wanna kill bunch of people take their oil and we gonna make tons of money of it, how do people
 you think would agree to that. They would not. So they have to have the reason. So with the civil war, the justification of that war was
 freeing the slaves. They never freed themm, they just changed them to a different form of slaves. Just like you and I. And when you speak of a slave, 
you just think of an afro/american person. It is a divide and rule contract, it is only about getting people to hate each other. Black hate whites.
 Whites hate blacks and separation that has nothing to do with the war. What was  basically happing, was the original states of america wasnothing 
 more than colonies that became union states which joined together in a union forming a governmen their country. It is just like what happens in Europe,
 you have got Netherlands, Sweden France, Germany, they are all states of Europe, but they are not united states of europe. It is the same when
 our coutry was founded, each state was literally a different country. <br>
We formed a union agreed and created a coutry called America. this is where they trick you. So when you see the United States of America,
 it is all about the actual land and actual constitution, that was originally started in 1781. When you see the word UNITED STATES, that
 is the corporation, that is located in DC in 10 square mile radius, District of Columbia. Now, it is so funny because who supposedly
 discovered America? It is ironic because they discovered a land that was already inhabited of milliions of  people for many years. 
District of Columbia is another name for District of Columbus, Columba a dove a symbol of babylon godess originally. Basically what
 columbus did, was discovered america , claimed it for Spain and slaughtered all of the native people. You do not hear that in the history books.
So what they basically did in the nuthshell was the UNITED STATES which is a corporation is a foreign country located in America, just like 
for example the Vatican over an Italy is not part of Italy it is own country. Just like the city of London. Do not mistake that for London the city.
 The city of London is part of London but it is own country. It is the same with DC. It is not part f of America, it is located on the continent 
of America. What they did was that they basically became the tradors to America and created their own government. To be in their law, you have to 
live in that ten miles radius of DC. Most people would say I live in New Jersy, I live in New york, that law does not apply to me. But it does. 
This is how they get you. When they had a civil war, there was  a lot of demage, a lot of  people worrying about death and destruction, was a lot 
of money that was being made and lost, that is the reason why Abraham Lincoln got assasinated, because to be able to be paid for the war, the war 
causes money because you have to pay for soldiers and the people to manufacture the wars, the weapons of mass destruction, they have to borrow money 
from banks. One of the ways to be able to get more money is Lincoln actually lovered the value of gold, so over night people lost 50 percent of their
 wealth. Allowed them to create more money so they can pay for war. Between 1863 and 1865, they got rid of the original constitution, change those words
 as I stated before and created new amandents which basically makes them and us all fraughts and tradors to the america. Let me explain what they did. 
One of the first thing they did was on December 6 1865, that was the thirteenth amandement, that basically in a nutshell was to abolish slavery so the 
way you think it means. <br>
I am gonna explain how slavery was actually better for the slaves before they fixed this because let's get into this. Slaves before the civil war,
 which unfortunatelly is only one specific gender of african american people, what they did was, they were considered property. which means the property 
is going to give you a benefit but you also have to take care of it, in other words. For example, one of your things of property you probably have is tv,
 and you would not leave a tv out in the rain, would you? NO, you keep it inside. it is like having a pet. Taking care of pet is your property. You know,
 if it is sick you gonna take it to the hospital if you love it and if it is your friend. You will gonna feed it, You will make sure you will take care 
of it. You will gonna give it a place to live but it is subject to whatever you decide like for example if you own a cat and you want affaction from your 
cat take  her even if she does not want it. She has to wait  until you decide to feed her. She is subject to your terms. You could be a good person which 
takes care of the animals or you could be abusive. But they stick around because they are dependent on you to take care of them. So with the slaves, what 
happened, yes they can be killed, yes they can be abused, yes they can be beaten, yes they have to do work what they probably they did not want to do but 
there were probably some benefits, they got food, they got medical care because most people profited of their slaves. When the slaves die, you do not have 
any profit any more, so you  basically take care of them, they give them food. water. shelter, protection, clothing, they provided these things. I am not 
saying the slavery was good. What I am saying is they went from those things were provided to them to when they were freed, they now became citizens and 
I will now explain what a citizen means it is not what you think. They went from being the slaves for the system, who were provided for to the slaves of 
the system, they still have to pay taxes, can still go to prison, still pay fines, you still under the laws of the government. You are still slave to teh 
system because you cannot drive 55 miles per hour without getting a ticket when you are pulled over. So now you are not really free. But here is the 
difference, now they have to get their own house, now they have to get their own clothes, find their own food. And if they are sick, they have to take
 care of themselves. that is the difference, so let's get to the 14th amendment. Now again , this is when they ratified the constitution, they basically 
destroyed the old constitution, overthrew the american government, people made a milliions of dollars off of this and people that were in the government 
at the time, they did not care because as long as they made theirs they did not care what it was going to do they created the corporation that they named 
the UNITED STATES, which is located in DC. Now again like I said before, dc is the district of columbia and it is of radius of 10 square miles, this is 
how they entrapped you. <br>
<br>

We start out, 14th amandement which started in July 14 1868, the amandement says, all persons, now remember you see the word person you think it is you 
and this is where they trick you, it is not you.
The legal definition of the word person is a corporation, a fictional character. They are not talking about you, the human, the natural human, they are 
talking about you the legal person. 
That is born or naturalized in the UNITED STATES, notice it does not say United States of America, it says all persons, corporations born or naturalized 
in the UNITED   STATES, the corporation they just do not tell you that and subject to the jurisdiction there of are the citizens of the UNITED STATES 
and of the state where they reside in. <br>
<br>
So ok let's break this down, lets get into the word citizen, again, when you think you are a citizen, well you are and I m gonna explain why it is bad.
Your polititians always saying we doing this for the citizens. YOu are citizen but you do not want to be because what the citizen means is 
one you are born and naturalize in the united states,
you are subject to the jurisdiction to the united states, not the americas, not the united states of america, the land where the original constitution was 
created but  they are talking about the corporation called united states. Jurisdiction means a certain perimeter. You do not have to be in that exact 
perimeter to be under jurisdiction like for exampple, if you are going to join the nra lets say you live in new york, the headquarters of the nra is in 
colorado. And  they say mail in your subscribtion and you will be part of the nra. What it does mean you have to mean to colorado, no. You are making your 
payment you are sending it over to them to colorado, they send you back your nra card and you now are the part of the nra. You are within their jurisdiction. 
 It does not always mean physical or literal. So when they say subject, what that does mean?
Well, go back to kings. What do kings have? Kings have subjects, who were subjects, they were the people who followed the king. You are subject to what the
 king says. So if the king said to do something you better do it because if you did not you probably get thrown in jail exiled or even executed, because what
 kings demand the subject have to follow. <br>
<br>
Lets read the 14 amendment, all persons (corporations) born and naturalized in the united states are the subjects to the jurisdiction therefore they are
 citizens of the UNITED STATES and the states in which they reside. Now let me explain state, it is not what you think it is.  For example, I live in New York.
 If you say, "you live in New York state, it is not the landmass  of new york where the land, that is the union  state of new York. Again,  they changed the
 wording, they changed it from the union state of New York to the state of New York, which in the nutshell is not talking about New York, the property that 
you are standing on, it is talking about the corporation called new york which is filed somewhere in Washington DC.  So when they say they own the land, now 
let me explain the definition of land, because this goes back to church. I made the videos in the past about how the vatikan has claimed the land ownership
of all the land and all its people. Well, the land is not what you think it is, not the legal definition. When you think land, you think property you think, 
dirt, you think grass, the land. Well that is how they trick you, the land definition is you, let me explain, Have you ever heard of will and testament? 
What is the will? It is you because you are giving away your property. The testament is the property, so what is the will? The will is you, and now, how
 do they figure that? You have a soul, or whatever it is in your body. Where does your soul live? it lives in you, so you are the land of your soul. so 
the definition of land in legal terms is not the actual ground, they are speaking about you so when the vatikan made claim over the land, it is not 
talking about the dirt, it is talking about you. So, you live in the state of New York, the state of arizona, the state of California, they are not 
talking about the land that you are walking on, they are talking about corporation known as the state of New YOrk which is nothing more than a piece 
of paper.  The corporation is just a word it is not anything specific. So when they say you live in the state of New York, that is  basically franchises 
of the corporation of the UNITED  STATES. Just as with Mc Donalds, there are different Mc Donalds on the land, they are subject to the jurisdiction of 
the corporation MC Donalds, in other words, the mc donalds in Haway, the mcdonalds in Florida and etc. cannot sell burger king because they are still 
corporation of MC DONALDS which says what they can and cannot sell. They are in different locations but they are part of the same corporation . That is 
what happens when you become a citizen. And how you become a citizen ? First of all, if you ever registered to vote, or to pay taxes, what are the first
 things that they ask you to check? Are you a US citizen? So when you check yes, you have now consented through your ignorance that you are part of the 
jurisdiction according to the  14 amendment, that was done with the new constitution of the UNited states, not the united states of the America, which is 
the coutry, but United states which is the corporation. So you actually willfully allowed yourself to be subject. NOw when you look at what they are talking 
about in the constitution, the reason the constitution exists is because of the consent of the goverment. Well, you remember when I talked earlier about the 
fact that the silence is the same as complience. In other words, if you do not argue what somebody claims, it si the same as you agreeing. So this is how they 
get you: there are approximatelly hundred million registered voters in the united states, not the united states of america, the corporation that is called
 United sTates. NOw, washington dc has three delegates, which means and this actuall proves that your votes do not count and do not matter and have not 
since the early 18 hundreds. Let say , 140 million people all decide to vote for the next prezident and every and every single one of them votes for 
one specific person. Vote only goes by delegates. So 140 million could have voted but because they are us citizens which means they volunteered to 
become subject to another foreign country that is made a deal from the Rothschilds from the city of London, this has also to do with money. This is 
made for the profit corporation called the united states. Well 140 million people get three delegates. How many people are there in the congress and 
the senate?Are there more than three? so when you get. So when you get more senators to go against you, lets say 4 of them decide to go the last time 
I checked 4 beats 3. So it does not matter who you vote because Washington Dc represents people only with 3 delegates. So lets continue with this scam, 
and again it has to do with your consent. YOu did not know about it but you did not argue it, so in law, if you are silent you have consented so 
technically, they are not doing anything wrong. Everybody says it is unfair, but if you are gonna to the court to fight this, you have to make sure
 you have the terms right. Under legal definition, is this not hte consent of the govern? Because who complained about it, who argued it, who disputed
 it? Who challenged it?  YOur silence is the same as your complience, so you are basically saying it is like working for the company valmar. You have
 benefits for working for Valmar. Lets say you are a manager and they give you paid vacations. They give you a health care. But they do not tell you
 if you work for valmar, and we tell you you have to work in Christmass time, no matter, how much you hate it, you do it. If we tell you to clean the
 toilets, you do not like it but you have to do it if you keep the job otherwise there is the door. you do not have to be part of corporation. So it 
is the same thing with this all  situation. Well you can get wellfare you can get healthcare you can get different types of benefits but they also make 
the rules like for example. You work as a cash register at Walmark and lets say your draw in your cash is 5 hundred dollar short. well, they can say
 you will pay that if they want, so in other words you can get punished. So if you get caught driving above 55 miles an hour, because they are 
responsible for you, you are their employee. They are your employer. So if you have an injury in the place, they have to take care of you.
 So if you are a Walmark  you slip forward and break your leg, they actually give you workers compensation, in other words, they are responsible. 
But again you can go around punching other people, because they are responsible, so you get fired so there are pros and cons. So fo example if
 you want to be a us citizen under the jurisdiction of united states corporation , well they have rules, Some of them are, you cannot liter you 
could be fined. You cannot build a house without a permit, you cannot drive a car without a licence and if you do any of these things, you are 
subject under their jurisdiction and they can fine you, or punish you, or tax you or whatever they want to call it and you have no legal right 
to say anything because even though you did not know about how the system works, you did not dispute it. So 140 million registered voters have 
consented through their silence that it is okay to be run by a foreign country that is not America. Just because the words look similar.  So think 
about that. This is how they get you and again we go back to the birth certificate, when you were born they took your dna which is an evidence of 
you existing. How they prove you exist? what you show a drivers licence? Any body can make a fake id, cannt he? You can say, while your parents 
said that or my birth certificate says that. They have the dna evidence of who you are, they own it because it was abandoned and because of admiralty law,
 just because you do not know about it does not mean it cannot affect, ignorance of the law is no excuse, well, they can say when you go to court, well,
 you do not own you , you know who owns you, you part of congress. They do not have the three branches legislation, judical, and executive. That is not 
the same anymore. YOu have basically the board of directors, which is congress, you have a ceo of the corporation which is the president and then you have 
the department of justice which works under the president who is the ceo. So lets go into birthing thing, everybody says, he was born in Kenya, he cannot
 be a president. Well, if it was based on the original United states of America, you are right, but since he works for a corporation.. I give you an example, 
do you have to be an american citizen to be the prezident of the corporation Walmar?   NO they do not care They have stores all around the world they 
have mcdonallds in france. so it is irrelevant, where barack obama came from, he is just running the corporation, anybody can run a corporation. and you
 did not vote him in unless all the rest of the congress does not decide to go agains to go against three american;s three delegates in washington dc. So
 this is how they are getting and entraping people and this is why people are thrown  in jail, this is why you have to pay mortgages, this is why you have 
to pay taxes, because if you declare yourself a us citizen, and you did not know what it meant, well, you have entrapped yourself, so here is the the thing. 
When you get to know this, what are you going to do about this? Because, you do not have to do this, it is based upon your consent. Well, silence is consent, 
now that you knoe what is going on, do you still wish to consent? What I am finding out for the remedy is, basically, we get reclaim our dna, get it back from 
them, that is what I am trying to figure out how to do. 
If I make a statement, that no people live in the state of New York, that is right. In the legal definition, they live only persons, not people. they are talking
 about hte piece of paper that is supported by their dna evidence. Definition of people is not the same of definition of person. 
They are 50 franchises in the corporation of United states. <br>

santos bonacci, dean cliffort curt callenbach, kate of gaia. <br>

When cops beating people, they are beating subjects, property, persons, they can do whatever they want. i fyou are a cattle rancher, you can print
 your marking into a cattle and guess what it is gonna hurt them but you will not get in trouble for him. Why? because they are your property. 
So there are rules, Just like, when you are a parent and you have a little kids. And you say as long as you live under my house you have to follow
 my rules. According to the way they scammed you , they own your dna, which is the only evidence of proof, that you really are who you say you are.
 They make a fake corporation in your name, they did not tell you about it, you went your whole life using that whole information . So you are not 
using you, you are using a fictional charecter that they pretend it is you and because you used it they basically can say they are right. 
Let me tell you something, have you watched all these tv shows about zombies and about all these waling dead? Well, guess what, you are walking dead 
you are the zombie. they can make fun of you because it does not mean that there are actually dead people rising from the grave, it means that you are
 under jurisdiction of under admiralty law, you were lost at the sea, they tried to find you by posting the birth announcement in the papers, nobody 
claimed it, and they have evidence  of who you are from the placenta, that of which is of your dna, they made a false fictional character of you and 
you are legaly dead. Because you have never come and reported it so it is time to get that back. So when you ever so a person to be executed, and they 
walk him down to the execution chamber, what do the other prisoners say? Dead man walking.  All those movies about zombis, that is you . They own you, 
how does that feel? So when cops beat people up, when government steal people money, guess what, it is not yours. if cops come and confiscate and break 
into your house, like they did during the boston bonbing when they just took people military gear and throw them out, you cannot complain, or when they 
shut down banks and have bank holidays, take all of your money and you sit there and comlain, it is not your money, it is theirs, they own rights to you 
because you have never disputed it, so all these people marching talking about hte civil rights, are actually asking to be a citizen, you do not want your
 civil rights you want your natural rights, there is a big difference. You do not want law that is based on their structure, which is admirality law, well
 how do you know you are in that? All you have to do is look at te american flag, if you see a gold ridge aroound the flag, that is a symbol of admirality law,
 it is a military flag. So the next time you see the prezident and that flag behind him, notice that gold ridge, that ain't america. that is UNITED STATES.
 So when you go around begging you are US citizen, you are basically saying you are a slave, and if you do not know the law, ignorance is no excuse. <br>


<br>

Straw Man<br>
First, I would like to acknowledge you that anything I will post here is not "LEGAL" advice, 
and should not be perceived as such. Everything described here is the theory of people researching
the subject.<br><br>

It is important, that anyone using this tactics and knowledge "MUST" know how to defend themselves 
properly in a courtroom. Lawyer's and Judges have a lot of knowledge and trickery to get you to consent
to their codes of practice, thereby rendering you liable to their penalties after you have been tricked
into giving up your "Inalienable Rights".<br><br>

Common law is the greatest protection anyone has against this system, government, and injustice. The states
in general have trampled the Law of the land into the dirt."<br><br>

Common Law is the Law of the Land and forbids harm or loss to others, and forbids you using mischief or 
fraud in your contracts.<br><br>

Government courts operate in Commercial Law and Maritime Admiralty Law.

These courts cannot be used against you as a man or a woman without your consent. These courts can only act
upon your "person", your straw man. <br><br>

What is a straw man?<br>
A straw man is the legal fiction your parents created and unwillingly signed over to the Government when
they registered you at birth. Your straw man is the "person" created by the birth certificate, and that 
the Government has title to.<br><br>

Actually, there are two you's. Or in my case, to me's. There is john smith man, and there is also JOHN SMITH,
 the "legal fiction". How many of you knew this?<br><br>

Think of an aspect of life that limits your freedom:<br>
 government and law enforcement<br>
 insurance and pharmaceutical companies<br>
 taxes<br>
 building permits<br>
 drivers licenses and more<br>
There are hundreds of stipulations, regulations and boundaries on our freedom. And out of these mentioned
here how many of these have you researched if they apply to you or not? Let's look at the forms of law that
currently acquiesce you.<br><br>

A common misconception among people is that any rule or regulation that governs them falls under one category, Law.
But there are many forms of law that people abide to without realizing that they simply do not apply to them.
Another misconception is that a nation's constitution gives us the rights. Constitution does nothing more
than lists the rights that we already have. We are born with Inalienable Rights endowed by our creator.
They can not be given to us or taken away, the most what a human being can do with a right is to choose whether
to exercise or not.<br><br>

Commercial Law and Maritime Admiralty Law is what is known as Law of Water, is super seeded by civil law and
only applies to those who willingly contract themselves into it. The definition of admiralty law is a body of
private international law governing the relationships between private entities which operate vessels on the oceans.<br><br>

Let's look at how why the form of law which is fashioned to corporations, business and vessels has imposed
its rule on natural human beings. This is whole done by the form of "word magic" A simple perversion of language
have made people believe that this alternative law apply to them. One of a predominant beliefs in modern culture
is that licenses, permits, registrations and documentation are required to operate motor vehicles, use public roads,
build structures and establishment, engage in free enterprise and much more. Sadly, these believes are based
on little or no investigation whatsoever and are false. This belief structure is perpetuated by Maritime Admiralty Law.<br><br>

The Admiralty Law was originally created to govern ships docking in foreign nations for import or export of products
and resources. It deals with banking and merchant affairs, not civil affairs. When a product is taken of a ship 
and brought to the land, that nation takes custody  of the resource and accounts for it with a certificate. That
certificate marks the birth day of the product in the custody of other nation. Think why it is supposedly required to 
have a certificate of life birth at first place?<br><br>

Barons dictionary of banking terms defines certificate as a paper establishing an ownership claim. So right there
you can notice that everyone with birth certificate is found being owned.<br><br>

Owned by whom?
People are used as collateral with other nations because the us is bankrupt. The us declared bankruptcy at March 9
1933. At this point, the us began taking loans from private non government affiliated organization called Federal Reserve.<br><br>

With no money to pay back the loans, the us began to use citizens as collateral. A birth and marriage certificates are
literally warehouse receipts. Just look at the similarities of warehouse receipts and birth certificates. Both document
the date of issue, a serial number, registration or receipt number, description of a product, and an authorized informant
to notify the appropriate government or agency. <br><br>

With all this information being rarely available, the majority of people are unaware of their involvement with Admiralty Law. 
This is possible through the manipulation of language. This Admiralty Law changes the meaning of word person from a natural 
living person to a corporation. Drivers licenses, vehicles registrations, insurance forms, permits, gun permits, work permits,
tax violation documents, birth certificates and other forms of such like documentation that were once believed to be absolutely
necessary only apply to persons or corporations. <br><br>

Upon signing such a legal document, you are indirectly waving your rights under the constitution and lowering your status to that
of a corporation, that is created with the same exact name as yours. The only way to reconcile your true name from the name of the 
corporation is take notice that the corporation has its name in all capital letters. This is known as Capitis Diminutio Maxima.
You may take notice that your driver license, birth certificate, social cards, insurance cards and more use all capitals letter to
legally represent the corporation with your name not you. <br><br>

The corporation is known as an artificial person, whereas you as a human being is know as a natural person. This deception goes 
even when it comes to courts we attend. When showing up in the court, you will notice that the seats for witnesses is behind the wooden fence
or barrier. The defendant must cross to the entrance to the other side of the barrier, where the judge sits. This act symbolizes the boarding
of a ship. At this time, business can be conducted in Maritime Admiralty Law. The judge acting as captain or banker is responsible for
settling the balance between two sides. This is why it is always monetary value involved in any court case. The captain is simply dealing with
banking and merchant disputes. Once the balance is paid, the case is closed. To turn the court-case away from the Admiralty Law where your rights 
are not protected, you must avoid agreeing to represent an artificial person. This is done by saying that you are the natural person, you do not 
have the first or last name because those imply corporate title. In a courtcase, you make say that the court takes the judicial notice of
of your honor's oath of office. <br><br>

Every judge must have take the oath of office to practice law. He must make it clear to the court and the jury that the judge is acting as a judge
and not banker. Remember, you are natural human being of the Earth, you are not governed by anything other than your own consciousness. <br><br>

Laws are created within the society, the society that created the laws we see being enforced today is called Law Society. Yet the most beautiful part
of this entire deception is the fact that we are not part of the Law Society, so their laws do not apply to us. Judges and layers are part of the society
within their society they created their own language that is deceptively similar to English, they have these little things called
Statutes, Acts and Regulations that seem like laws but they really apply only to those within their society. So that basically means, all the traffic 
violations, minimum age requirements and everything accept the damage to another person or property does not really apply to natural person. Laws only apply to 
those within the law society. The game being played is an illusion. You can simply choose to open your eyes and claim the freedom you are born with down by nothing 
but the limits of your imagination. These are just a few examples of assuring that your rights are being protected. By far, the most important defense against this
deception is to be aware of the perversion of language and be absolutely aware of how you form your beliefs and concepts. <br><br>

In all forms of perversion of language, there is a mirror reflection of this in a microcosm of the psyche. <br><br>

And the truth is, that we truly do not know ourselves any more. We have the jobs, the children, the house, the bills, the television. And with all the hobbies and programmes
we watch we were made to believe that this is what we actually are. But who are we deep down aside of black or white, republican or democrat,
mother or father, we do not know. And this answer we do not want to accept by ourselves so we deny it. Well, pass it of or project it on somebody else 
and judge them for it. This is repressed and we can see what repression can do on an individual level what about collective level of humanity?
What happens when the whole world would like to take the question seriously and demand the answer who we really are. <br><br>
