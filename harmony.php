We are neither our names nor our titles. We are all one consciousness. There are no fields - electric, dielectric, gravitational and magnetic. They are only different expressions of one ether field, infinite consciousness.
There is no need to be angry or act violently or instinctively after you get these principles and understand the true nature of reality. While you find out there is no rush, no pressure no time no hurry to do anything,
there is just a fulcrum, harmony, balance which holds everything together.<br>
If you ever come into a situation where you are tempted to act violently or aggressively only because the world is so so crazy or somebody is enforcing a new rule judgement or prejudice or even laugh onto you, 
which e.g restricts your basic freedoms, contradicts your ideas, does not resonate with you, just... <br>
1. Take a deep breath, step back, count to 10 and look at it again
2. If it does not help, ask yourself or the opponent a question "And?" What is the big deal, why should you take sides or even oppose something. When, in fact, what you oppose, you become... <br>
3. If it still does not help, ask yourself or the opponent, "how many people died?" Is it really so serious to deal with it instinctively? <br>
4. There is no better thing to do than to laugh at things you do not understand or you are unwilling to do. Laugh at the system because you've got the right. Exercise the right! Every authority or rule then becomes nothing
more or less then you having no clue at all what to do next. <br>

You are what your inner self is. You project your inner self to be precise. And this outer projection of your inner self is what influences your inner self and inner self of others the most. With laugh you can immediately 
change that projection and become a completely different person. And you will not see the world as the same again. In fact, you can change it all by yourself. Think about it for a while, how powerful you are.

A true nature of time... You are and you are not at the same time. It is like a spiral, going upside down, round and round in a never-ending permanent cycle.<br>

Today I have bumped into a great gentleman named Tullio Simoncini, who fundamentally changes the view of cancer treatment. It is another way to treat this disease alternatively. 
He argues that the primal cause of this disease is a fungus and too acidic environment in our bodies caused by current food and medical treatment. Everything important is available

Everything this world is made of, material or not, comes down to be a vibration or a frequency. You can easily imagine it as disturbed stillness always trying to come back to itself. 
A sinus function is a perfect example depicting such an effort (See an illustration). Furthermore, material world as we know it, manifests itself only in one direction, which is for me a true natural phenomenon. 
It is this in combination with our left brain sequential decoding which gives us a misperception of linear time.

Everything in nature starts with circle and numbers...
Time is illusion, time is in reality a cycle, a loop that takes the Earth around the Sun
